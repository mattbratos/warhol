title: Why
description: Why Warhol exists.

I started **warhol** for fun.

I wanted a project where I could:

- learn Codex better by building something real,
- create my first CLI tool,
- and build my first Go project.

I currently do not know how Go works yet. I do not know the syntax or the language ecosystem.
This project is a deliberate test: can I build a useful CLI tool in Go while learning from zero?

That is the point of Warhol.
